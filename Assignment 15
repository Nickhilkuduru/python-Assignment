1.How many seconds are in an hour? Use the interactive interpreter as a calculator and multiply the
number of seconds in a minute (60) by the number of minutes in an hour (also 60).
sol. 60 

As.60*60 = 3600

2. Assign the result from the previous task (seconds in an hour) to a variable called
seconds_per_hour.

Ans.seconds_per_hour = 3600

3. How many seconds do you think there are in a day? Make use of the variables seconds per hour
and minutes per hour.

Ans.24 x 60 x 60 = 86400 seconds

4. Calculate seconds per day again, but this time save the result in a variable called seconds_per_day

Ans.seconds_per_day = 86400

5. Divide seconds_per_day by seconds_per_hour. Use floating-point (/) division.

Ans.24.0

6. Divide seconds_per_day by seconds_per_hour, using integer (//) division. Did this number agree
with the floating-point value from the previous question, aside from the final .0?

Ans.Yes, it agrees. The answer is 24 (the same as the answer from the previous question).

7. Write a generator, genPrimes, that returns the sequence of prime numbers on successive calls to
its next() method: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, ...

Ans.
def genPrimes():
  num = 2
  while True:
    isPrime = True
    for i in range(2,num):
      if num%i == 0:
        isPrime = False
        break
    if isPrime:
      yield num
    num += 1

1. What exactly is []?

Ans.[] is an empty list.

2. In a list of values stored in a variable called spam, how would you assign the value &#39;hello&#39; as the
third value? (Assume [2, 4, 6, 8, 10] are in spam.)

Let&#39;s pretend the spam includes the list [&#39;a&#39;, &#39;b&#39;, &#39;c&#39;, &#39;d&#39;] for the next three queries.

Ans.spam[2] = &#39;hello&#39;

3. What is the value of spam[int(int(&#39;3&#39; * 2) / 11)]?

Ans.The value of spam[int(int('3' * 2) / 11)] is 3.

4. What is the value of spam[-1]?

Ans.The value of spam[-1] is the last element in the list.

5. What is the value of spam[:2]?

Ans.The value of spam[:2] is a tuple containing the first two items in the spam list.

6. What is the value of bacon.index(&#39;cat&#39;)?

Ans.The value of bacon.index('cat') is 3.

7. How does bacon.append(99) change the look of the list value in bacon?

Ans.It changes the value of the list from [4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42] to [4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42, 99].

8. How does bacon.remove(&#39;cat&#39;) change the look of the list in bacon?

Ans.It does not change the list.

9. What are the list concatenation and list replication operators?

Ans.List concatenation is the operator that joins two or more lists. The list replication operator creates multiple copies of a list.

10. What is difference between the list methods append() and insert()?

Ans.The method append() will add an element to the end of the list while insert() method inserts at the given index.

11. What are the two methods for removing items from a list?

Ans.The two methods are `remove()` and `pop()`.

12. Describe how list values and string values are identical.

Ans.List values and string values are both composed of a sequence of characters.

13. What&#39;s the difference between tuples and lists?

Ans.Lists are mutable, while tuples are immutable.

14. How do you type a tuple value that only contains the integer 42?

Ans.(42,)

15. How do you get a list value&#39;s tuple form? How do you get a tuple value&#39;s list form?

Ans.You can use the tuple() function to get a list value&#39;s tuple form, and the list() function to get a tuple value&#39;s list form.

16. Variables that &quot;contain&quot; list values are not necessarily lists themselves. Instead, what do they
contain?

Ans.They contain pointers to the first element in the list.

17. How do you distinguish between copy.copy() and copy.deepcopy()?

Ans.The copy module provides two functions, copy() and deepcopy(), for duplicating original objects. The difference between the two is that copy() makes a shallow copy and deepcopy() makes a deep copy.
